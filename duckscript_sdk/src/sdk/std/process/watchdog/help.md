```sh
count = watchdog [--max-retries value] [--interval value] [--input value] -- command [arguments]*
```

Executes the provided native command and arguments.<br>
In case the command exited it will be executed again up to the max retries provided.<br>
The watchdog will wait the specified interval in milliseconds between invocations.<br>

### Parameters

* --max-retries - Positive value of max retries (excluding the first invocation). value <= 0 for unlimited retries. Default is unlimited.

* --input - Optional content to be sent to the child process input stream.
* The command to execute (preceded by a **--** separator).

### Return Value

The amount of invocations or false in case of any error.
